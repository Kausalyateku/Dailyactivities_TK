///NAB(Network Acceleration Blade)

A Solace PubSub+ appliance relies on several interfaces and internal routing components to enable the transfer of data between the appliance and either management applications that connect to the applianceâ€™s management interfaces or client applications that connect to the appliance's Network Acceleration Blade (NAB) interfaces. 


Replacing an Existing NAB with a NAB with Fewer Ports
You can replace one model of NAB with another model NAB that has fewer Ethernet ports.

Step 1: Back Up Current Configuration
Before making any configuration changes, back up the current event broker configuration.


solace1> enable
solace1# copy current-config pre-nab-upgrade-backup-file
solace1# exit
solace1> show current-config all > pre-nab-upgrade-config

Step 2: Make Required Configuration Changes
If you switch to a NAB with less ports, the following configuration changes are required:
LAG Configuration
Bridge Configuration
Replication Configuration
Message Backbone VRF Configuration
IP Interface Configuration
Routing Interface Configuration

Step 3: Reload Event Broker Configuration
After making the necessary configuration changes, reload the event broker configuration:

solace# reload
This command causes a reload of the system
Do you want to continue (y/n)? y

Step 4: Backup Event Broker Configuration
solace# copy current-config nab-upgrade-ready-backup-file
solace# show current-config all > nab-upgrade-ready-config

Step 5: Power Down Appliance
solace# power-down
This command powers off the appliance and does not restart it afterwards
Do you want to continue (y/n)? y

Step 6: Physically Change Out NAB


NAB Interface Configurations

The following configuration options are supported for the network interfaces on the NAB:

->Group the NAB ports into one or more LAGs. The number of LAGs possible for the network interfaces is limited by the number of Ethernet ports present (due to the fact that LAGs reuse MAC addresses allocated for Ethernet ports).
->Assign independent IP addresses to each NAB port (that is, no LAG configured).
->A mixture of both, that is, have some of the Ethernet ports grouped into a single LAG, and the remaining ports independently addressed.
